# QuaSI
an ImageJ/Fiji macro for **QUA**ntitation and **S**egmentation of microscopic **I**mages

Crucial parts of image analysis are integrated into a streamlined workflow in a user-friendly, semi-automated, yet flexible way. QuaSI contains 5 central independent functionalities (‘modules’): (i) Image visualization including channel merging and on-the-fly data annotation, (ii) definition and (iii) quantitation of ROIs (regions of interest), (iv) foci detection and quantitation, and (v) ROI annotation on-the-fly. Within each module, a user-specified set of images is sequentially loaded and interactively processed. QuaSI aims to provide researchers with an easy-to-use toolset to extract quantitative information out of standard microscopic images, minimizing the need for manual processing where possible while maintaining the option of manual curation where necessary. Please refer to the user guide for more specific information.

QuaSI is accompagnied by a set of R import scripts to facilitate downstream analysis of the image quantitation output.
